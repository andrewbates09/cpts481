# Final Project Ideas
These are [python] poject ideas for the CptS 481 final project.

## Signal Flare
A word of mouth location aware notification system. By taking user posts and opt-in data locaiton, we can create a 'trending heat maps.'  This has a few main approaches:

1. Scrub currently existing social networks for information
2. Create a completely independent application/network
3. Combination of 1 & 2

## LUG Automatic Door
Using the currently existing gear system and motors, redesign current door opener for Raspberry PI and python.

## F.E.R.G.U.S AI
Finally an Effective Resposive and Generally Useful System

Use a Rasberry PI or Beaglebone to create a simple command and chat AI butler (J.A.R.V.I.S. inspired, of course).

* [motion detection](http://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=45235)
* [personal assistant](http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/2014/04/jasper-personal-assistant-for-raspberry-pi/)
* [speech recognition](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/SpeechRecognition/)

## Parallel Pi Cluster
By using multiple mini ARM machines (Raspberry PIs or BeagleBones), I could build parallel system and basically just do some math on it.
